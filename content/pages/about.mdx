## whoami?

My name is Emilio Ziniades. I am a South African. I was born in Johannesburg and live in Cape Town. I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics, then an honours degree in Economics, at the University of Cape Town. I graduated in 2019. 

## economist-turned-programmer

During the pandemic years, I spent a lot of my time indoors learning programming. I had always been fascinated with computers and programming languages but being in lockdown shortly after graduating gave me the space I needed to explore these topics further. I began learning Python by purchasing an online course, and soon realized that the internet is a wealth of free resources, provided that you know where to look. My main sources of information became various documentations, as well as YouTube.

Coming from an economics background, my main interest is data analysis. After using Stata at university for econometrics projects, I found that processing and analyzing data in Python was like breathing fresh air. Its aesthetic simplicity really appealed to me, there was a vast package ecosystem, and once I had picked up the language's idioms, coding in Python felt like writing English. I pursued a variety of projects analyzing datasets, often producing accompanying vizualizations and sometimes writing about them. 

Although this exploration began with Python, it spread to a variety of fields and languages. I learnt about the web stack: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I taught myself React, and learnt about static site generators via Gatsby. I even tried to learn some PHP so that I could customize a Wordpress website I had built for my teaching business. After that, I became more interested in backend engineering, and so decided to learn Go. I realized how little I knew about computer science concepts such as Big-O notation, algorithms and data structures. I  tried to pick up as much of this knowledge as I could by doing practical projects. A combination of coding puzzles like Advent of Code and Project Euler combined with pursuing my own personal projects ensured that the theoretical concepts I was picking up were applied to practical problems.

## what do I do? 

During my time at the university, I worked as a tutor in the Economics and Philosophy departments, teaching, marking essays, and co-ordinating course activities with the lecturers.

For the last three years, I have worked for myself, offering tutoring lessons to both university and high school students. I love teaching, and find it very rewarding to help clarify concepts for others. It also forces me to constantly learn new things, and helps me consolidate my own knowledge. 

At some point, I also began to pick up some freelance programming jobs. I helped an artist build a Wordpress website to display his work and offer it for sale. I also assisted people who wanted to purchase some Bitcoin from exchanges and store it safely in a hardware wallet. I did a few seed and passphrase recovery jobs, which required some brute force searching on a rented AWS server. I helped someone recover BTC that he had sent to a LTC address by tweaking the derivation path in an Electrum wallet.

## crypto is cool

As I was learning about programming, I was also learning a lot about cryptocurrencies. I was lucky to discover some excellent teachers online, such as Andreas Antonopoulos. And through his textbooks, I learnt a lot about Bitcoin, the Lightning Network and Ethereum. As an economist-turned-programmer, this nascent field grabbed my attention. It changed the way I view money. It became apparent to me that cryptocurrencies represent the merging of economics and computer science. And I wanted to get stuck in.

Growing up in South Africa, I am very sensitive to social and economic inequality, and this perspective informs my approach to cryptocurrencies. Whilst they have enormous potential, I also recognize the very real risks of wealth concentration that exists. I wish to help my fellow South Africans understand and use cryptocurrencies to replace the burdensome and costly payment networks that exist currently. In particular, I believe there is a lot of opportunity to use the Lightning Network to facilitate payments in South Africa's economy, a large portion of which is informal and cash based. 

## maybe we could work together? 

Currently, I am in the process of looking for work in the cryptocurrency space. I am open to remote work. You can find my resume [here](https://emilio.co.za/resume). If you are interested, please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://emilio.co.za/contact).
