## testimonials

_“Emilio tutored my son Adam in science. I have known Emilio for a couple of years and knew he was smart, what I didn’t know until he started tutoring Adam was how well he connects with the students he tutors and how he is able to explain and get them to understand concepts that they had previously battled with. Adam found his sessions with Emilio fun AND constructive, a fact that was born out by the significant improvement in Adams marks. I highly recommend Emilio as a tutor, a great investment in your child’s education.”_

– Jill Wolfe, St John’s College Parent

_“Emilio is a wonderful person and tutor. He helped Stefanie tremendously with teaching her how to write an essay properly & the more she does them, the better she gets at them.”_

– Alex Dunnington, Kingsmead College Parent

_“Emilio is helpful in that he helps you find the answer through guiding you towards it rather than just doing the work for you. He’s a good tutor because he’s patient but not overly involved in the work as he allows you to find the answer rather than you being told what it is.”_

– Lebone Lehloke, former St John’s College Student
