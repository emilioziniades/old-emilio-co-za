# tailored tutoring for high school and university students

Since 2016, I have managed my own tutoring business. I have also tutored and marked essays for the Philosophy and Economics departments at the University of Cape Town.

I hold a BSocSci in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (with distinction) and a BCom Hons in Economics from the University of Cape Town. I matriculated with nine distinctions from St John’s College, Johannesburg.

Online or in-person, I can support you with your immediate study needs, and share with you my personal study and organizational techniques which have help me achieve excellence throughout school and university.
